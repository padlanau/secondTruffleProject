/**
 * @title  Solidity Visibility
 * @author Lodgerio Padlan
 * @dev visibility is to restrict access to functions and state variables in our smart contract
        Public   - anyone can execute/call the function and use the getter function to get the state variable
        Private  - only functions in this contract can invoke a private function
        Internal - private and contracts deriving (implements) from it
        External - only available from other contract (not within the smart contract). Only external entities can invoke a function or access a variable


 * @notice A simply smart contract to demonstrate visibility in Solidity
